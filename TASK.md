## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- [ ] **Fallback**: Multi-purpose chat for existing n8n workflows
  - Risk: Complex n8n integration fails
  - Mitigation: Focus on workflow analysis and improvement suggestions
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate against real n8n instance
  - Risk: Generated workflows don't work in n8n
  - Mitigation: Use current node specifications and validation
- [ ] **Scope Management**: Core features over advanced features
  - Risk: Running out of time
  - Mitigation: Prioritize working basic functionality

### Competition Risks
- [ ] **Demo**: Prepare multiple workflow examples
  - Risk: Limited demonstration scenarios
  - Mitigation: Create diverse, impressive workflow templates
- [ ] **Documentation**: Track all prompts and decisions
  - Risk: Losing track of AI model usage
  - Mitigation: Document all Claude interactions
- [ ] **Submission**: Early submission buffer
  - Risk: Last-minute technical issues
  - Mitigation: Submit 2 hours before deadline
